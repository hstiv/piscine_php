<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The vertex color is from ex00.

• The Vertex Class must provide reading and writing assessors for its five attributes.

• The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:
’x’: x axis coordinate, mandatory.
’y’: y axis coordinate, mandatory.
’z’: z axis coordinate, mandatory.
’w’: optional, by default is worth 1.0.
’color’: optional, by default is worth a new instance of the color white.

• The Class includes a Boolean static attribute called verbose to control the
displays related to the use of the Class. This attribute is initially False.

• The Vertex Class has a __toString method. See example output for formatting. Please note that the vertex color is added to the string if and only if the
static attribute verbose is true.

• If and only if the static attribute verbose is true, then the Class constructor and
destructor will produce an output.

• The Class must has a static method called doc that returns the documentation of
the class in a string. (in this specific case the documentation does not have to be
long). The content of the documentation must be read from a Vertex.doc.txt.
